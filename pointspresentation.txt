----
user friendly

in our experience we found trello
simple to use with assigning tasks to each member of the team.
trello played an essential part to keep the project on track
we were able to see the overall picture of the project, keep track
of each memeber's tasks. 
any new idea's we had it went on the trello board for implementation.
we would use trello for future projects
